Whispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following effects within range:

*   You create a tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts what the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours. The effect might manifest as a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 round.
    
*   You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom.
    
*   You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube.
    
*   You instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
