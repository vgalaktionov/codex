# Silence

#### 2nd-level illusion

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.
