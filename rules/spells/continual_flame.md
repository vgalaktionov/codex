# Continual Flame

#### 2nd-level evocation

A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesnâ€™t use oxygen. A _**continual flame**_ can be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.
