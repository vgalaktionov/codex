# Invisibility

#### 2nd-level illusion

A creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the targetâ€™s person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
