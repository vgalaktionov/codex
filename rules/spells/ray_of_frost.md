A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

The spellâ€™s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
