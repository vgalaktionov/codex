# Enhance Ability

#### 2nd-level transmutation

You touch a creature and bestow upon it a magical enhancement. Choose one of the following effects; the target gains that effect until the spell ends.

_**Bear’s Endurance.**_ The target has advantage on Constitution checks. It also gains 2d6 temporary hit points, which are lost when the spell ends.

_**Bull’s Strength.**_ The target has advantage on Strength checks, and his or her carrying capacity doubles.

_**Cat’s Grace.**_ The target has advantage on Dexterity checks. It also doesn’t take damage from falling 20 feet or less if it isn’t incapacitated.

_**Eagle’s Splendor.**_ The target has advantage on Charisma checks.

_**Fox’s Cunning.**_ The target has advantage on Intelligence checks.

_**Owl’s Wisdom.**_ The target has advantage on Wisdom checks.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
