# Scorching Ray

#### 2nd-level evocation

You create three rays of fire and hurl them at targets within range. You can hurl them at one target or several.

Make a ranged spell attack for each ray. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level above 2nd.
