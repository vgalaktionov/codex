Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting _**contingency**_, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn’t come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a _**contingency**_ cast with _**water breathing**_ might stipulate that _**water breathing**_ comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.

The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then _**contingency**_ ends.

The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one _**contingency**_ spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another _**contingency**_ spell on you ends. Also, _**contingency**_ ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.
