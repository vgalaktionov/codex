This spell assaults and twists creatures’ minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it. An affected target can’t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.

| [d10](javascript:void(0); "Roll the dice!") | Behavior |
| --- | :-- |
| 1 | The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction.  
To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face.  
The creature doesn't take an action this turn. |
| 2-6 | The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn. |
| 7-8 | The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined  
creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature  
does nothing this turn. |
| 9-10 | The creature can act and move normally. |

At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.
